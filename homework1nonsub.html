Emphasizing on Keywords, and their purpose
</h1>
<br>
<p> The keywords that are relevant to our products are; starwars, collector figurines, and reasonably priced. We will purchase and advertise through these keywords. Keywords are words or phrases that will match your product, that are relevant to what a consumer may be searching the internet for. Purchasing a keyword is a terrific marketing plan, as one becomes more profitable through less effort. We are only purchasing keywords with commercial intent. When we purchase the keywords, our product will be one of the first options when a consumer browses or shops through a search engine. When we purchase the keywords, our product will be filtered by the search engine used as one of the most suggested options for the browser. The search engine simply advertises our product for us.
